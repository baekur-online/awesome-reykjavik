[Bus.is](https://www.bus.is)

[Strætó](https://s.is) operates buses across the capital area. Bus schedules and route information is accessible via Google Maps, Transit, Moovit and the [Klapp app](https://www.klappid.is/). Buying tickets used to be available in the [Strætó app](https://www.straeto.is/en/um-straeto/straeto-appid), but not anymore. Sometimes there are also night buses. Strætó has stops in front of the largest banks, the hospital (Landspitali), and near the immigration office. It's a great way to get around if you have extra time on your hands. For example, if you need to get to the hospital or leave it then you can take the route 6 bus from the Snorrabraut bus stop or take the route 1 or 3 bus from the Læknagarður (the Doctor garden) bus stop.

## About the Klapp app
To ride the bus, buy a ticket using the Klapp app. You can buy tickets in advance using a credit or debit card (excluding American Express). Tap on the ticket to activate it when boarding the bus. Scan the QR code using your phone as you board.

The app also has a route planner and a live map to see when the bus is coming.

Monthly and annual passes are available but don't provide significant savings unless you're using the bus every day. It is also possible to get a discount on the monthly or annual passes if you are a student.

!!! warning
    Buses accept cash payments but don't provide change. Buy a ticket using the app instead.

1. First is through Strætó on weekdays.
